## How to start.
- Start the actual telegram bot going one level above the django project and excecute the main.py file with the command "python main.py"
- Now both the telegram bot and the backend server are running and can be tested.

## What was made to make the code maintainable?

- Separate the important information as constansts at the beginning of the script in order to easily change some of the parameters, like the video it will use to search the frames, the base url of the backend server, or the questions for the FAQ.
- The code was heavily commented in order to make clear what is happening at all times.
